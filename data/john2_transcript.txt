[John]  But Abhinash was not able to complete his sentence. He felt such an intense pleasure in abusing Binoi that he was incapable of even pretending to be anxious on his account. (1.10s - 10.98s)
[John]  In less than no time, all the important members of Kura's party came in turn. (11.45s - 15.49s)
[John]  And when they were all gathered, a heated discussion soon started on the subject of Benoit's Kanda. (15.75s - 21.06s)
[John]  The majority of them had only one comment to make, and it was that this present affair was no matter for surprise, because they had all of them again and again noticed signs of weakness and hesitation in Benoit's character. (21.55s - 34.13s)
[John]  They declared that Benoit had never surrendered himself wholeheartedly to their party. (35.25s - 39.38s)
[John]  Many of them said they had always felt how intolerable was the way in which he had tried. (39.74s - 44.52s)
[John]  Somehow or other from the very beginning in which he had tried somehow or other (44.66s - 49.94s)
[Vaibhav]  But they merely laughed at me and ended by taking me for a feeble-minded fool. (52.59s - 57.21s)
[Vaibhav]  They exonerated me. (57.31s - 58.92s)
[Vaibhav]  explaining that they had asked for whatever they had and that it had been bound to happen. (59.30s - 64.61s)
[Vaibhav]  Finally, they warned me that I was becoming dangerous. (65.03s - 67.70s)
[Vaibhav]  and that they would have to lock me up in a madhouse if I didn't shut up. (68.19s - 71.84s)
[Vaibhav]  That hurt me terribly. (72.42s - 73.68s)
[Vaibhav]  Sorrow compressed my heart and I felt I would die and then well (74.05s - 77.87s)
[Vaibhav]  It was morning already. (79.57s - 80.84s)
[Vaibhav]  the sun had risen but it had (80.96s - 82.69s)
[Vaibhav]  Wars after fight. (83.01s - 84.56s)
[Vaibhav]  I found myself in my old armchair. (85.19s - 87.22s)
[John]  where everyone else had kept himself at a proper distance out of respect. (88.19s - 91.96s)
[John]  Benoit had forced himself from Gora (92.23s - 94.12s)
[John]  and made out that he was in terms of such intimacy (94.32s - 96.97s)
[John]  that he appeared to be aloof from the rest of them. (97.19s - 99.45s)
[John]  and equal in importance to Gora himself. (99.69s - 101.83s)
[John]  because Gora was fond of him. (102.06s - 103.93s)
[John]  They had all of them done their best to tolerate this extraordinary arrogance, and this was the deplorable sequel to that kind of unchecked vanity. (104.00s - 111.99s)
[Vaibhav]  Nothing really, I don't know Lisa. You see, I used to know a strict, stern man who would go down on his knees before his daughter and (113.29s - 122.01s)
[Vaibhav]  Kiss her hands and feet. (122.33s - 123.64s)
[Vaibhav]  He just couldn't admire her enough. (124.02s - 125.90s)
[Vaibhav]  She could spend the night dancing and her father would stand in the same spot for 5 hours without taking his eyes off her. (126.31s - 132.01s)
[John]  They said, we may not be so well educated as Binoy Babu and we have not such great intelligence, but at least we have all along followed one principle, we don't say one thing and think another. (133.01s - 144.00s)
